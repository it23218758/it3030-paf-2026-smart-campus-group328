## Performance Considerations

**Current Implementation:**
- Polling every 30 seconds for notification count
- Notifications loaded on demand when page is visited
- Database indexed on `userId` and `isRead` fields

**Recommended Improvements:**
- Implement WebSocket for real-time notifications
- Add server-sent events (SSE) for live updates
- Implement notification aggregation (group similar notifications)
- Add pagination for notification list
- Implement push notifications using service workers
