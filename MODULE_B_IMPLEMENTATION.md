# Module B – Booking Management - Implementation Status

## ✅ ALL FEATURES IMPLEMENTED & WORKING

### 1. Booking Request Form ✅
**Location:** `frontend/src/components/BookingForm.jsx`

**Features:**
- ✅ Select resource/facility from dropdown (ACTIVE resources only)
- ✅ Date and time range selection (datetime-local inputs)
- ✅ Purpose of booking (textarea)
- ✅ **Expected attendees** (number input) ⭐ NEW
- ✅ Conflict detection error handling

**Backend:** `backend/src/main/java/com/smartcampus/model/Booking.java`
- ✅ Added `expectedAttendees` field
- ✅ Added `rejectionReason` field

---

### 2. Booking Workflow ✅
**Workflow:** PENDING → APPROVED / REJECTED → CANCELLED

**States:**
- ✅ **PENDING** - Initial state when user creates booking
- ✅ **APPROVED** - Admin approves (generates QR code)
- ✅ **REJECTED** - Admin rejects with reason ⭐ NEW
- ✅ **CANCELLED** - User can cancel their own pending bookings

**Implementation:**
- `BookingService.createBooking()` - Sets status to PENDING
- `BookingController.approveBooking()` - Admin approves/rejects
- `BookingController.cancelBooking()` - User cancels

---

### 3. Conflict Detection ✅
**Location:** `backend/src/main/java/com/smartcampus/service/BookingService.java`

**Method:** `createBooking()`
```java
List<Booking> overlappingBookings = bookingRepository.findOverlappingBookings(
    booking.getResourceId(), 
    booking.getStartTime(), 
    booking.getEndTime()
);

if (!overlappingBookings.isEmpty()) {
    throw new RuntimeException("Resource is already booked during this time window.");
}
```

**Query:** `BookingRepository.findOverlappingBookings()`
- Checks for overlapping time ranges
- Only considers PENDING and APPROVED bookings
- Ignores CANCELLED and REJECTED bookings

**Result:** ✅ Prevents double-booking of resources
